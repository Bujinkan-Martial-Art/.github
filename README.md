## In the ’50’s Hatsumi Sensei met Takamatsu. One rainy morning under the maple trees, Soke bound that connection to all of the Bujinkan ##
I had a simple plan to teach 片腕遁走型 Kata Ude Tonsō Gata. But during my preparations for class that night, I was overcome with gratitude toward my teachers. It seems there was a secret power bound up in this kata.

It can be described as 師逢和瀬 Shiawase. Let me tell you how I discovered it.

The Bujinkan has made my life rich. I have made so many friends all over the world. Thank you to my students who come to class and allow me to study <del>on</del> with them. Thank you for reading this and for watching my videos or subscribing to my training website. Thank you everyone who invites me to teach seminars.

I prepare for every class I teach. I feel I owe it to my students to do my home work. But I don’t just owe it to them, I owe something more to my own teachers.

I have studied the kata I was planning for this class with many teachers over the decades. But one of my favorite moments was studying this with Hatsumi Sensei under the Japanese maples during the year of the rat.

師逢和瀬 Shiawase is a play on words. Normally it uses different kanji and means しあわせ shiawase: happiness;  good fortune;  luck;  or blessing. But with the kanji Soke uses it suggests that by meeting a master teacher you will find good fortune and happiness. Or even, that simply finding a master teacher is good fortune in itself.
<h3>Part One: Mysterious Bujinkan Training</h3>
My unique experience seemed to happen by accident. But I think there was a lot more going on that led us to this special training with Soke. In fact, some of the most mysterious aspects of our Ninja lineage may have been at work. More about that in a moment.

What brought us here? That year there had been some changes in the Bujinkan organization. One of Soke’s longtime Hombu administrators resigned with some controversy. I won’t focus on gossip, but the result was that the location for our training had not been reserved.

Normally we would have trained at Ayase, but the Tokyo Budokan often requires reservations more than 6 months in advance. Well that didn’t happen. So Soke needed a spot that could host a lot of people.

Luckily, one of Soke’s early students, Kobayashi San, was the Assistant Director of  <a href="https://www.shimizu-kouen.com/">清水公園 Shimizu Koen</a>. This is a beautiful natural park and campgrounds in Chiba. When I heard that we would be training there I was excited.

My anticipation only grew on my flight over to Japan. I normally travel there 3 times per year for training. But before this trip, life had kept me away longer than normal.

The previous year was the first time any of us saw Hatsumi Sensei with purple hair. He showed up to the Daikomyosai with a strange maroon tint. We all thought it was a bad dye job. But it has grown brighter and brighter purple every year since.

When I got off the plane and rode the train in the crisp fall air out to Noda, the first thing I saw was Hatsumi Sensei’s bright purple. And he even decided to talk to us about it that night.

Normally he doesn’t say anything about it. He jokingly told a friend of mine that it was to protect him from sexually transmitted diseases. But that night he told us that in Kabuki theatre, they wear a purple scarf on the head to denote death.

His tone when he said this was somber. The dojo grew quiet. He told us how a kiai was a projection of one’s heart or spirit into the kukan. He said that the color of your heart was projected out like an aura. I wrote more about this in my article, <a href="https://www.rojodojo.com/iro-%E8%89%B2-attach-to-color-follow-the-color/">Iro 色: Attach to Color, Follow the Color</a>. He said the color came from your character or could even be the color you decide to send out!

This was my first class straight off the plane. I didn’t know that it would be the beginning of many mysterious moments like that over the next few weeks.

It started with the weather…
<h3>Part Two: Bujinkan Training in Nature</h3>
It was late fall, early winter. The weather was very cold. And the rain didn’t help. I knew that tomorrow morning we were training outside in the wilderness. I wondered how I could survive three solid days of training in this cold rain.

The next day I woke up too early. I looked outside. Rain.

I put on as many layers, hats, gloves, underwear, sweaters as I could stand. I went to the train station. The rain was falling and the windows of the Tobu Noda Line were steamed up.

I had a nice half hour ride, enjoying the heater under the seat.

I got off at my stop with quite a few other Bujinkan friends. None of us knew where we were going. But we opened our umbrellas and started walking.

<a href="https://www.rojodojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ShimzuKouenNiouMon.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3664" src="https://www.rojodojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ShimzuKouenNiouMon.jpg" alt="仁王門 nioumon gate of 金乗院 Konjou-in" /></a>

The walk was a lot farther than I expected. It took us down a long highway, then into the park. We walked through the historic 仁王門 nioumon gate added in 1711 to 金乗院 Konjou-in which was founded more than 600 years ago in 1398, past a ninja obstacle course, and some boarded up cabins, wet and grey among the trees.

I walked alongside my friend Craig Olson. We had our usual rambling conversation full of bad jokes. He had lived in Japan many years and did a lot of translating for Hatsumi Soke. I often bother him when I need help with something I can’t translate.

Craig is a tall man and walks quite fast. We turned down more than one wrong hiking trail. But I didn’t care because the brisk walk kept me warm.

<a href="https://www.rojodojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ShimizuKouenZouSo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3665" src="https://www.rojodojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ShimizuKouenZouSo.jpg" alt="座生荘 Zaō sō" /></a>
We arrived at an old, prewar building called 座生荘 Zaō sō that first opened in 1937. Just as we walked up, the rain stopped. We changed into our training gear inside. Then we went out to check the condition of the training area.

The ground was a carpet of red Japanese maple leaves mixed with some yellow gingko. The trees were still dripping from the rain. The morning sun broke through the clouds and angled down through the fall colors, gleaming off the water droplets.

It was overwhelming for the senses. The birds were chirping, the leaves were falling. The rain brought out the rich smells of this Japanese forest. Then Hatsumi Sensei showed up wearing what looked like a bearskin vest. It felt like I was in a ninja fantasy land.
<h3>Part Three: Ninjas in the Forest</h3>
This year the theme we were studying was ninjutsu. Hatsumi Sensei got right to work. He used all of the nature around him: Trees for climbing, shielding and attacking; Leaves, rocks, and roots for metsubushi or as natural weapons; He pointed out the behavior of the birds, and the signs on the ground for tracking. He threw people into thickets and made them slip in the mud.

Even as an old man he was climbing trees!

He showed us how in Togakure ryu you condition the hands with Japanese walnuts. One of the Japanese teachers dug some out of the ground for me. They are quite sharp. Of course Soke stabbed and cut people with them. He also explained how to hollow them out to use them as containers for metsubushi.

He showed us a technique for listening to the sounds in nature for reconnaissance. The animals, birds, and insects all have a language that provides a lot of information. Listen well and you will know where everything is and who or what is moving through the forest.

<a href="https://www.rojodojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shimizuKouenPond.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3666" src="https://www.rojodojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/shimizuKouenPond.jpg" alt="shimizu Kouen Pond" /></a>

This rich nature training experience made my own personal connection to our whole lineage seem very real. Here I was training in the same environment and under the same types of trees as the people who started our art. I was training with the 34th Soke of Togakure ryu in a long lineage stretching back to before the 12th century.

Togakure ryū came from the Gyokko ryū of Hachidō Nyūdō through Kagakure Dōshi to Togakure Daisuke. It then passed on though Momochi Sandayū to the Toda family, to Toda Shinryūken Masamitsu, Takamatsu Toshitusgu then Hatsumi Masaaki.

And now here I was training not only with Soke, but a number of people that had trained directly with Takamatsu. The connection is unbroken. Then I take it home and pass it to my own students. Takamatsu Sensei could never have predicted the mysterious connections that would lead a red headed boy born in Arizona to study his art in the forests of his own country.
<h3>Part Four: The Spirit of Takamatsu</h3>
I think Hatsumi Sensei realized the importance of this connection. Soke told us that this year marked the 37th anniversary of the passing of Takamatsu Sensei. He remembered taking both Senou Sensei and Kobayashi San when they were teenagers down to Kashihara to meet Takamatsu Sensei.

He asked them to speak about their meeting with Takamatsu. Then he sat down on his antique looking battlefield 床几 shougi (japanese camp stool) and simply listened.

Kobayashi began by welcoming us to Shimizu Koen in his role as Assistant Director of the park. He continued,
<blockquote>“Because Hatsumi Sensei helped me stay on the right path in life, I was able to take this post. I’m 60 years old now, but I was 16 when I had the chance to meet Hatsumi Sensei.

At that time I studied the way of the ninja. I studied the techniques, but I also studied the way to cultivate my heart and spirit (精神勉強). Senou Sensei and I were in the same class at High School together. We were peers. I started training a few months earlier than he, and Hatsumi Sensei said, don’t you have any friends you’d like to bring with you?

Since that day we’ve been connected, right now Senou Sensei is repairing my car.

The biggest memory I have about Takamatsu Sensei is that in China he had the opportunity to apply what we are learning. His fingernails were the thickness of a ten yen coin.”</blockquote>
Senou Sensei joined in,
<blockquote>“You’ve all heard the story many times about Takamatsu’s fingernails, but that doesn’t give the reality of it. They were very painful. You probably couldn’t cut them with a normal pair of nail clippers, you had to use pliers.

When Takamatsu Sensei passed, Kobayashi san and I received a phone call from Hatsumi Sensei saying that he had passed away. Hatsumi Sensei invited us to his house. Then we went out together for a walk and didn’t say much. We just looked at the sky and remembered Takamatsu Sensei. That’s a memory that sticks in my mind.”</blockquote>
Kobayashi remembered,
<blockquote>“The first time we met Takamatsu Sensei he was actually very quiet. He didn’t say much but his eyes really had something.”</blockquote>
<a href="https://www.rojodojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ShimizuKouenTree.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3668" src="https://www.rojodojo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ShimizuKouenTree.jpg" alt="Shimizu Kouen Tree" /></a>Senou added,
<blockquote>“When we visited Takamatsu Sensei’s house, we arrived before Takamatsu Sensei, so we were invited to wait on the second floor. We were having a conversation when Hatsumi suddenly said, Takamatsu has arrived! We looked but we didn’t see him. we turned back and then looked again and there he was.

That's what sticks in my memory... the way he silently climbed the steep stairs leading up to the second floor. Then he swung or swiveled like a puppet into the doorway making it difficult to see him. I have a strong memory of that twisting movement of his entrance.”</blockquote>
Senou Sensei and Kobayashi San began to get lost reminiscing together. Soke just sat chuckling in the background from his stool. I think he enjoyed their sense of awe about his teacher even after all these years.

Kobayashi continued,
<blockquote>“It’s kind of an eerie feeling we had visiting Takamatsu Sensei. We felt like he could see through us and know who we were immediately.

We were asked to perform an 演舞 embu at 橿原神宮 Kashiwara jingu in Nara-ken at the gravesite of one of the emperors (this is also the location of the 高松塚古墳 Takamatsuzuka Kofun, Takamatsu burial mound). Because we were students of Hatsumi Sensei, we felt everyone treated us like grandchildren.”</blockquote>
Senou agreed,
<blockquote>“Takamatsu sensei was watching us at that embu and afterwords he performed a 剣舞 kenbu for us which is a ceremony with the sword and singing at the same time. When he did that it was a fake sword, but when I saw the performance I felt like it was a real sword.

One time Takamatsu pierced his arm with a needle and then stuck a candle on the end of it and lit it…”</blockquote>
After listening quietly, Soke spoke up,
<blockquote>“Sticking the needle through the arm is called udekou. It’s a way of creating good fortune. The dance that Takamastu Sensei performed was a form of entertainment to entice these young men to come and train with him. that was the first time I had ever seen that udekou ritual. Takamatsu Sensei was quite the gentleman and every time I visited I was taken care of very well. he was a very good host.”</blockquote>
*note: Soke told this same story on another occassion like this: そして腕に針を刺し、ロ一ソクに火をつけ、芙化針棒の神に祈り...

Senou adds,
<blockquote>“We had the opportunity to have training from Takamatsu Sensei. I was there one year before he died. While Takamatsu Sensei was teaching us ganseki nage with Hatsumi Sensei as his uke, he tried to throw, but he fell to one knee.”</blockquote>
Soke stood up and said,
<blockquote>“It was a very nice funeral. Many people came. There were many priests present. There were many 樒 shikibi (japanese star anise flowers) lined up. It was quite a large presentation.

For 15 years I had the opportunity to train with Takamatsu Sensei and after training at night he would always bring two bottles of sake. But for those 15 years I never drank the sake. And then at the funeral for the first time I drank a cup of sake. I later corrected this error by drinking with Noguchi Sensei for 15 years.”</blockquote>
We all laughed. Then Soke stood between Senou Sensei and Kobayashi San. He pointed at both of them.
<blockquote>“This (縁が enga) connection of fate through these two still remains after 37 years and that’s important. We learned that it’s important not to sever that connection with Takamatsu Sensei so that he is still here today. If you cut the connection with the air then you’ll suffocate. I’m very thankful to Kobayashi san for allowing us to use this location to train. I know Takamatsu Sensei would appreciate it.”</blockquote>
Then without any fanfare, we began training with 片腕遁走型 Kata Ude Tonsō Gata. All of those memories filled the air as we threw each other around in the fallen leaves. Later that afternoon, Hatsumi Sensei asked us to stand in gassho to bow out facing the sunset.
<h3>Part Five: Mysterious Bujinkan Weather</h3>
As soon as he left, it started raining again. I said something to Noguchi Sensei about how nice it was that the rain had stopped during our training. He laughed and told me about the times they had been driving to an outdoor location to film Hatsumi Sense’s videos when it was raining. Hatsumi Sensei asked them to stop the car and he got out and did some kind of prayer or kuji beside the road. Then the rain went away during their video shoot.

This is known as 天門 tenmon, one of the 忍身十八形 ninja juhakkei (18 skills of the ninja). It was one of the many mysterious things I experienced that day during our ninja training under the Japanese maples.

As Soke told us that day, don’t sever your connection with the kukan or you’ll suffocate. His playful admonition is really telling us that the kukan is full of mystery, and it holds all the history, teachings, and connections that I describe above. I don't know why anyone would choose to break away from this rich heritage.

For me and my students, the circle is full when I teach something like <a href="https://www.rojodojo.com/%e5%8f%b3%e7%89%87%e8%85%95%e9%81%81%e8%b5%b0%e5%9e%8b-migi-kata-ude-tonso-gata/">片腕遁走型 Kata Ude Tonsō Gata</a>. My own students can trace their introduction to this fundamental form of ninjutsu from me directly to Hatsumi Sensei, and then to Takamatsu, back through the generations. This is the secret power hidden in a simple kata.

We are very fortunate to have these insights available to us. I have to humbly thank my teachers and my students for keeping this connection alive so we can receive this treasure and great history of our art.

If you do not understand what you are missing, then get connected. This is how you cultivate good heart and spirit. Then the Bujinkan will be better with you in it.
